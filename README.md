# obstification overide web

this will contain an html base for anyone who wants to get past
school blockers. this html gets past because it sends the request 
in a way that only the deobstification-overide-server on my page 
can understand. you do have to run a ngrok (if you dont know how look it up)
and painfully put the whole link into the html file in the "https://ngrok-here.com" 
section.
